> Now a day, technology is on a boost. People wish to live a luxurious life with minimum physical work. Here we provide a mobile application for ‘Bike Service System’. This application is an android app which can be run on any android compatible tablets and mobile phones. The app will enable any bike user to search and communicate with any bike service center in the vicinity. The user can find the service centre, get its location and check and select any of the services provided by the respective service center. The user can send requests for pick and drop, appointment for servicing, test drive as well as accessories purchase to the dealer. The dealer processes these requests and gives a response back to the user through push messages.
